User profile:

My target audience consists of IT companies looking to hire individuals who are students or have a degree in computer engineering. My goal is for them to be impressed by either the design of my website or the information included in the pages. The needs of the people visiting my website are to recruit new employees. The age range is not a priority, but I do prefer that their location be close to mine.

Information architecture:

I have structured my website in such a way that at the top, in the header, there is a search bar where users can search for the information they need. The body is divided into 4 sections. The first 3 are organized in columns. On the left, I have all the personal information, such as my "About Me" section, my location, my phone number, my Gmail, and my social media links, where users can also contact me. In the center column, I have all the photo content, such as my resume photo, and below that, a photo carousel showcasing the projects I have worked on, where clicking on a photo redirects you to the project links. In the right column, I have all the knowledge and skills, including the programming languages I use and other skills. Below that, there's a section with the languages I speak. Finally, at the bottom of the body, I have my professional and academic background. I didn't create a footer, as I didnâ€™t see it as necessary.

Visual design:

I was thinking about what designs I could create to make the website original and unique. In the end, I was inspired by the Photoshop program, a photo editing tool. To create the feeling of being in Photoshop, I added the typical top panel found in Mac applications, where you can close, maximize, or minimize the window. I also included the option to close the window using JavaScript. I also created different blocks representing the various options found in Photoshop, such as the search option, which allows you to search for any word, like a phone number, on the website. Another feature I implemented is the option to expand or collapse the contents of a folder. In the INFO section, when you click the downward arrow, it hides the information, and if you click again, it shows it again. I also created dark blocks under the text, emphasizing that these are fields where you can type. Finally, I added a photo carousel where you can see all the projects I have worked on, and if you click on a photo, it takes you to the page where my projects are uploaded.
